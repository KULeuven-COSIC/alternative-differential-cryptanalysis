# Alternative Differential Crpytanalysis

This repository contains code to perform differential cryptanalysis using alternative operations.

## Project Structure

- `n2/`: tools and computations for the parallel case $d = n-2$, $m=2$;
- `n3/`: tools and computations for the case $d = n-3$;
- `diff/': code for alternative differential cryptanalysis.

The usage of the code is explained in each folder.
