# Alternative differential cryptanalysis

The file `a.cpp` contains code to run differential experiments using alternative operations. It can be compiled with `g++ -fopenmp -o a a.cpp` (requires `openmp`). An example cipher from the paper "Differential experiments using parallel alternative operations" is given in the folder `data`. Different parameter can be set up in the code.
